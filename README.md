# Twitter and TweetDeck in #280Characters

Twitter has [released 280-character tweeting](https://blog.twitter.com/official/en_us/topics/product/2017/Giving-you-more-characters-to-express-yourself.html), but only to a small group of people during a trial period. This Chrome extension adds the ability for everyone to tweet in 280 characters, on both [Twitter.com](https://twitter.com/) and [TweetDeck](https://tweetdeck.twitter.com/).

Install the extension on the Chrome Web Store: *(Not available yet: it is awaiting approval)*

There is no tracking code (ehem, unlike the *Tweet 280 Today!* extension). The source code is available here on GitHub and pull requests are invited.

This extension works thanks to tricks by [@Zemnmez](https://twitter.com/Zemnmez/status/912876877391335424) and [@Prof9](https://twitter.com/Prof9/status/912859110776950784). It's likely Twitter will modify their systems to prevent these hacks, so don't be surprised if it stops working.
