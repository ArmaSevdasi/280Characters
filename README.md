# Twitter and TweetDeck in #280Characters

Twitter has [released 280-character tweeting](https://blog.twitter.com/official/en_us/topics/product/2017/Giving-you-more-characters-to-express-yourself.html), but only to a small group of people during a trial period. This Chrome extension adds the ability for everyone to tweet in 280 characters, on both [Twitter.com](https://twitter.com/) and [TweetDeck](https://tweetdeck.twitter.com/).

Install the extension on the Chrome Web Store.
